# Contributing

Thank you for working on this project! Follow these steps to open a pull request cleanly:

1. **Create a topic branch** from the latest `main` (for example, `git checkout -b feature/my-change`).
2. **Make your changes** and keep commits focused on a single concern so they are easy to review.
3. **Run the relevant checks** (e.g., `npm test`, `npm run lint`, or `npm run build`) to confirm the project still works.
4. **Commit** with a clear message describing the change.
5. **Push and open a PR** against `main`, including a short summary of what changed and which tests you ran.

If you are applying a patch from your clipboard, you can pipe it into `git apply` and then continue with the steps above.
