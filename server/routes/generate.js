// This file is an obsolete CommonJS router and is incompatible with the project's "type": "module" setting in package.json.
// The active routing logic has been migrated to `server/routes/generate.ts`.
//
// This file is intentionally left with a null export to cause a server startup error if it's accidentally imported,
// helping to identify and fix incorrect module resolution. Please remove any imports pointing to this file.
